The **login** theme was copied from the folder `themes/keycloak/login` of a keycloak 4.5.0 instance. The only difference here is the new background image `jambit.jpg` which is referenced in the `login.css` file.

There are certainly more advanced customizations possible. Detailed information about themes can be found here:
